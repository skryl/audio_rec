Written by: Alex Skryl (askryl@enovafinancial.com)

Summary:
AudioRec's purpose is to recursively sift through a large collection of misnamed
audio files and rename them to match the data in their respective tags. It can also
organize the files in a temp location if directed to do so.  

Requirements:
libid3-3.8.3-dev (debian lib)
id3lib-ruby (ruby gem)
flacinfo-rb (ruby gem)

Supported Audio Formats:

TODO:
- support more formats
- allow more flexibility for organization
- bring name formatter string CL options
